NannyBot is an independent project I spent about 2 months developing in my spare time.
I developed it to assist my partner at the time who was growing crystals in a lab as part of his Phd. He needed a "zoom style" programme that can run on the lab computer and record the crystals he is growing and video stream it to distant devices, so they can be monitored when he isn't physically in the lab. Similar to a "plant monitor", the program was to start and stop recording at regular intervals (example - record 10 seconds, then don't for 20 minutes. repeat). the program was to also display data scraped from the machines monitoring the crystal in the lab, info such as temperature, light angle etc. 

The program contains a server side (to run in the lab) and a client side (to run at home). It utilizes google proto for efficiently transferring the data across the network. Later versions utilize json to save user settings such as theme colour (the client end has a user interface with menus.. the user interface was made with qtgui). I used both signals and threads (multithreading) for efficient running of the programme. In one version I added a newsfeed that shows a random recent article title from online science magazines that can be clicked to open said article, just for fun to play with web scrapers).

The server is made to restart automatically in case of a crash. Upon startup a check is made weather this is a startup or a post-crash restart (if starting up user must enter info such as ip and recorder settings, if restart the startup menu is skipped and saved settings from previous run are loaded).
