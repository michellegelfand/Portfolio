  
use the .sln file to access both the snake and pacman projects

Pacman is still in progress and currently has 3 characters-
Pacman (yellow): controlled by player
Blinky (red): chases pacman aggresively
Clyde (purple): is stupid, moves randomly

I plan on adding Inky (Wont attack on his own but gets the courage when Blinky gets close to Pacman
and Pinky- chases Pacman if Pacman gets close to her
